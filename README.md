# computing-project

Final project for the Computing course LSGNT - 2017.

This is the computing project of Pol Van Hoften & Lorenzo La Porta.

Our goal is to use Python to crack classical cyphers, like Caesar's and Vigen√®re cyphers, using frequency analysis,
perhaps dropping some standard assumptions that one usually makes about the original text. For instance we would 
like to see if it is possible (and how hard it is) to crack these cyphers without any prior knowledge of the 
original language in which the message to decode was written.
